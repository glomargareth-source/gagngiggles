gagngiggles

A mildly chaotic repository of small, niche projects built for curiosity, testing, and the occasional nerdy chuckle.
This repo is my sandbox with rules: a place to poke at ideas, stress-test my understanding, and build tiny things that are just big enough to be interesting—and small enough to finish before enthusiasm evaporates.
No grand product vision. No “world-changing” claims. Just experiments that make my brain stretch and occasionally go aha.


What lives here

You’ll find projects that are:
Small, focused, and intentionally limited
More interested in how something works than how fast it runs
Explicit in logic (no wizardry behind the curtain)
Often delightfully niche


Think:
Micro tools for finance, logic puzzles, or text quirks
Helpers that assist thinking, not replace it
Scripts that follow rules very carefully and explain themselves while doing it

These are not full systems. They’re thought exercises with code attached.


Why this exists

This repository exists to:
Test my understanding by building from first principles
Turn abstract ideas into concrete, runnable things
Practice clarity over cleverness
Prove to myself that “I get it” means “I can explain it to a computer”

If the code feels a bit verbose, that’s intentional.
If something seems over-explained, that’s a feature.


Tech stack (so far)
Python, leaning heavily on the standard library
Minimal dependencies, by design rather than accident
Built with a phone-friendly workflow in mind

Tools are chosen cautiously. Magic is avoided unless it’s well-documented magic.


Documentation style

Projects here aim to include:
A short explanation of what the project does (and very importantly, what it does not do)
Straightforward variable names and readable logic
Comments where reasoning might otherwise feel like a leap of faith


If something is assumed, it should be stated.
If something isn’t confirmed, it should admit that openly.


Future direction

Right now, this repo lives comfortably in logic-land.
Later, it may grow tentacles into:

Front-end experiments
Simple interfaces layered on top of existing logic
Visualizations that make rules and constraints easier to see

When that happens, the spirit stays the same: understand first, decorate later.


Status

Actively tinkered with. Cheerfully incomplete.

Some projects will stop once the learning goal is reached.
Some will be refactored just for fun.
Some may exist purely because a question wouldn’t leave me alone.

That’s the vibe.
