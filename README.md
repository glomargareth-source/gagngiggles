## What This Is

A collection of tiny projects I build when curiosity won't shut up.

This isn't a portfolio. It's a sandbox where I:
- Test half-formed ideas
- Build things just to see if I *can*
- Write code that explains itself out loud
- Finish projects before the dopamine wears off

No unicorns. No disruption. Just nerdy little tools that scratch specific itches.

## What Lives Here

You'll find:

- **Sudoku helpers** that whisper possibilities
- **Existential simulators** that track your mood vs your choices
- **Finance micro-tools** that do one thing obsessively well
- **Logic puzzles** turned into patient, verbose Python
- **Text manipulators** for problems nobody asked me to solve

These projects are **small by design**. They do one thing, explain how they do it, and stop before feature creep sets in.

---

## The Philosophy

I write code like I'm teaching it to someone who's skeptical.

- **Explicit over clever.** If the logic isn't obvious, I comment it.
- **Readable over fast.** Performance comes after understanding.
- **Verbose over magical.** I'd rather see 10 lines of clear code than 1 line of wizardry.

If something feels over-explained, that's the point. I'm not writing for experts—I'm writing for Future Me, who will have forgotten everything.

## Why This Exists

Three reasons:

1. **To test my understanding.** If I can't code it, I don't really get it.
2. **To practice clarity.** The computer doesn't let you fake it.
3. **To have fun.** Sometimes the best reason to build something is "because I was curious."

This repo is proof that I can turn abstract ideas into working things. Even if those things are small. Even if nobody else needs them.

## Tech Stack

- **Python** (because it reads like pseudocode)
- **Standard library** (minimal dependencies = minimal surprises)
- **Phone-friendly workflow** (coded on Pydroid3, debugged with patience)

I avoid magic unless I understand the spell.

## What's Next

Right now, this is logic-land. Pure functions. CSVs. Algorithms.

Eventually, I might add:
- **Simple UIs** (Kivy, maybe React)
- **Visualizations** (making constraints visible)
- **Interactive demos** (so ideas feel tangible)

But the core stays the same: **understand first, decorate later.**

---

## Status

🟢 **Actively tinkered with**  
🟡 **Cheerfully incomplete**  
🔵 **Will always be a work-in-progress**

Some projects will stop when the learning goal is met.  
Some will get refactored just because.  
Some exist purely because a question wouldn't leave me alone.

That's the vibe.

## A Note on Style

If you're reading this code and thinking *"Why didn't they just use X library?"*—you're probably right.

But the point isn't efficiency. It's **understanding.**

I build things from scratch not because it's better, but because it teaches me how the magic trick works.

Once I understand it, *then* I'll use the library.
